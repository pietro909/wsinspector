# WebSocket Inspector

##Inspector? You mean...
I've decided to build this little tool after spending my last two years working with WebSockets: I'd like to 
have a small utility for debugging and testing.

##Project's status
At this stage, I've just collected my requirements. You'll find them in Documentation/requirements.md.
Then I made up a quick UI wireframe (you can see it in Documentation/wireframe.png).

Please feel free to fork, extend, ask...
