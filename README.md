# WebSocket Inspector

##Inspector? You mean...
I've decided to build this little tool after spending my last two years working with WebSockets: I'd like to 
have a small utility for debugging and testing.

##Project's status
At this stage, I'm trying to collect my requirements. You'll find them in Documentation/requirements.md

Please feel free to fork, extend, ask...
