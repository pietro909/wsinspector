# WebSocket Inspector

##Inspector? You mean...
I've decided to build this little tool after spending my last two years working with WebSockets: I'd like to 
have a small utility for debugging and testing.

##Project's status
First, I've just collected my requirements: you'll find them in Documentation/requirements.md.
Then I made up a quick UI wireframe (you can see it in Documentation/wireframe.png) and built the first html/css UI.
After that I started implementing the UI basic functions and bindings: as you'll notice, I'm using AngularJs.
This could look like an overkilling, but in the first place I consider it the best frontend framework for a developer coming
from C/Java like me and moreover I'm using it at work as a primary tool so I want to use it also in my personal projects.

Please feel free to fork, extend, ask...
